#Summary:
#This is a multi-purpose script to control an LED strip
 #If a single argument of the name of a prepopulated color is passed into the script, it will change to that color
 #If no arguments are passed in and the script is called, it will try and ping a hostname specified in a variable and based on that either switch color to green, red, or no change to indicate whether the hostname is online
  #If you point this at a common website, for example Google, the LED strip can be used as an online/offline indicator
  #The script can easily be called by a cron job that runs every minute

#Future plans:
#Maybe use curl or requests to get a color variable from my website, sanitize the input, then change to that color instead of just red/green if the variable was found
 #The website colors could also be controlled from a button on the page and/or discord API
 #Could also change state from pinging internal resources so that each server has a color and if that one has issues change to that color LED like color code errors for certain outages, DNS, high CPU, high fans, high power usage, etc.
